# Jimple
What is Jimple? Jimple is the intermediate representation [**IR**]{A data structure which represents (source) code} of Soot.
Soots intention is to provide a simplified way to analyze JVM bytecode. For this 
purpose Jimple was designed as a representation of JVM bytecode which is human readable.

## Jimple Grammar Structure
Jimple mimics the JVMs class file structure.
Therefore it is object oriented.
A Single Class (or Interface) per file.
Three-Address-Code which means there are no nested expressions.
(nested expressions can be modeled via Locals that store intermediate calculation results.)


### Class (or Interface)
A class consists of Fields and Methods.
It is referenced by its ClassType.


### Field
A Field is a piece of memory which can store a value that is accessible according to its visibility modifier.
It is referenced by its FieldSignature.


### Method and the Body
The interesting part is a method. A method is a "piece of code" that can be executed.
It is referenced by its MethodSignature and contains a [**StmtGraph**]{a control flow graph} that models the sequence of single instructions/statements (Stmts).


### Signatures
Everything that we can reference across a method (e.g. a Class, Interface, Method or Field) - which is basically every item//TODO:wording that is not a Local - has a Signature.


### Trap
A Trap is a mechanism to model exceptional flow.


### Stmt
The main piece of Jimple is a Statement (Stmt). [**Stmts**]{formerly known as Units} represent that can be executed by the JVM.


#### Branching Statements
A BranchingStmt's job is to model the flow between Stmts.


##### JGotoStmt
for unconditional flow

##### JIfStmt
for conditional flow depending on boolean Expression (AbstractConditionExpr) so they have two successor Stmt's

##### JSwitchStmt
for conditional flow that behaves like a switch-case. It has #numberOfCaseLabels+1 (for default) successor Stmt's. 

All other Stmts are not manipulating the flow, which means they have a single successor Stmt as long as they are not exiting the flow inside a method.


##### JReturnStmt & JReturnVoidStmt
They end the execution/flow inside the current method and return (a value) to its caller.


##### JThrowStmt
Ends the execution inside the current Method if the thrown exception is not caught by a Trap, which redirects the execution to an exceptionhandler 


##### JInvokeStmt
transfers the control flow to another method until the called method returns. 


##### JAssignStmt
assigns a Value from the right handside to the left handside.
On the left handside can occure a Local referencing a variable (i.e. a Local) or a FieldRef referencing a Field.
On the right handside can be an expression (Expr), a Local, a FieldRef or a Constant.
##### JIdentityStmt
is semantically like the JAssignStmt and handles assignments of IdentityRef's to make implicit assignments explicit into the StmtGraph. 

#####JEnterMonitorStmt & JExitMonitorStmt
marks synchronized blocks of code from JEnterMonitorStmt to JExitMonitorStmt.


##### JRetStmt
##### JBreakpointStmt
models a Breakpoint set by a Debugger (usually not relevant for static analyses)


### Immediate
An Immediate has a [**given**]{as in constant or immutable} Type and consists of a Local ("a Variable", "Sth that contains a Value") or a Constant ("Sth that is a Value").


### Type
VoidType
#### PrimaryType
BooleanType, ByteType, CharType, ShortType, IntType, LongType, DoubleType, FloatType

#### ReferenceType
ClassType, 
ArrayType
NullType

#### Local
```
$i0 
```
[Whats this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FLhO7ZnKHs&t=54s)
A Local is a variable and its scope is inside its method i.e. no referencing from outside a method.
Values can be assigned to Locals via JIdentityStmt or JAssignStmt.


#### Constant
represents a value itself. don't confuse it with a variable/Local which has a immutable (i.e. final) attribute. 

There exists a constant entity for every Type - that way all value types can have a representation.

### Expr
// TODO


### Ref
#### JArrayRef
```
$arr[1]
```
referencing a position inside an array.

#### JFieldRef (JStaticFieldRef & JInstanceFieldRef)
```
<SomePackage.ExampleClass: fieldname>
// or
$r1.<SomePackage.ExampleClass: fieldname>
```
referencing a Field via its FieldSignature and if necessary (i.e. with JInstanceFieldRef) the corresponding Local instance that points to the object instance.

#### IdentityRef
The IdentityRef makes those implicit special value assignments explicit.

##### JThisRef
```
@this: package.fruit.Banana
```
represents the this pointer of the current class.

##### JCaughtExceptionRef
```
@caughtexception
```
represents the value of the thrown exception (caught by this exceptionhandler).

##### JParameterRef
```
$i0 := @parameter0
$i1 := @parameter1 
```
represents a parameter of a method, identified by its index.
